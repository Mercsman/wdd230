    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <li>Joining the Commerce - Before Jerry was a member of the chamber, he was just trying to figure out how to best run his business on his own. After finding the chamber website and joining, he has now been able to connect with other local businesses.
    This allows Jerry to have advice from others who are in a similar position to him and he has a bigger network to reach new potential customers.</li>
    <li>Attractions in the area - Gwen wants to know what attractions are in the area so she can write about them in her blog. The chamber website provides some places of interest for a visitor to see.
    This also allows the chamber to share some of the other nearby places someone may want to visit while going to those locations. This helps Gwen decide where she may want to go first. </li>
    <li>Learning more about the city - Gwen wants to learn more about the city after visiting some of the notable attractions. The chamber website helped her find some other locations that had historical importance to the city.
    The website also helped her get into contact with community members who are knowledgeable about the city. </li>
    <li>Learning more about the local businesses - Both Gwen and Jerry want to know more about the local businesses. Jerry wants to know who he can make business friends with and who are his potential competitors.
    Gwen wants to know where she can get local food and items and support the locals. Both of them can find the information they need on the chamber website. </li>
    <li>Finding community members and community events - Both Gwen and Jerry want to be active in the community. Jerry wants to connect with other members in the community and participate in local events. This allows Jerry to make his business more well known and helps him grow his network with community members.
    Gwen wants to find out more about the local gems that might not be front page news. By looking at the chamber website, Gwen can find smaller local events as well as bigger ones she can write about in her blog.</li>
